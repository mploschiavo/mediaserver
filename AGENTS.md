# AGENTS.md

## Why This File Exists
This repo is a declarative media platform, not a click-through homelab script bundle.
Agents and contributors must optimize for:
- Reproducibility
- Safe automation
- Clear ownership boundaries
- Backward-compatible operations by default

## Source Of Truth (Priority Order)
1. Declarative config in `bootstrap/media-stack.bootstrap.json`
2. Kubernetes manifests in `k8s/**/*.yaml`
3. Typed/defaulted behavior in Python services under `scripts/bootstrap_services/`
4. Runtime app state (UI edits) as temporary drift to be reconciled back into code

If a behavior differs between UI and repo code, repo code wins after next reconcile/bootstrap.

## Architecture Layers
- Orchestration entrypoints:
  - Bash wrappers in `scripts/*.sh` (thin only)
  - Python CLIs in `scripts/*.py`
- Domain/service logic:
  - `scripts/bootstrap_services/`
- Reusable bootstrap helpers:
  - `scripts/bootstrap_lib/`
- Cross-cutting infrastructure helpers:
  - `scripts/core/`
- Shell shared helpers:
  - `scripts/lib/`

### Boundary Rules
- Domain modules do not call shell directly.
- Side effects go through small adapters/services.
- Stateless transforms stay as pure functions.
- Avoid hidden global state when dependency injection is practical.

## Design Rules
- Prefer composition over inheritance.
- Use OOP only when state ownership/lifecycle is explicit.
- Use dataclasses for config/DTO-style records.
- Introduce patterns only when they reduce complexity:
  - Strategy for real behavior variants
  - Adapter for legacy/shell integration
  - Decorators for retries/timing/instrumentation

### Avoid By Default
- Deep inheritance trees
- Singleton-heavy designs
- Abstract interfaces with one implementation and no boundary value

## Bash vs Python Policy
Keep Bash when it is a tiny, stable wrapper.
Migrate Bash to Python when logic includes non-trivial branching, loops, parsing, retries, JSON/YAML transforms, or needs tests.

## ConfigMap Packaging Contract
When bootstrap code is mounted into Kubernetes jobs, all required modules must be present.
- Source list for bootstrap script packaging lives in:
  - `scripts/lib/bootstrap-script-configmap.sh`
- Do not duplicate `--from-file` maps across scripts.
- Any new import path used by `bootstrap-apps.py` must be added to this shared mapping.

## Logging, Errors, and Secrets
- Use structured logging via `scripts/core/logging_utils.py`.
- Never log secrets, tokens, passwords, or API keys.
- Raise typed exceptions from `scripts/core/exceptions.py` for expected operational failures.
- Include enough context for diagnosis: namespace, app, phase, command target, remediation hints.

## Compatibility Requirements
Preserve unless explicitly documented:
- CLI flags and exit code semantics
- Environment variable names
- Config file formats
- Manifest interfaces consumed by existing scripts/automation

Wrapper scripts must maintain historical CLI behavior (help text, error handling, return codes).

## Testing Requirements
Minimum for refactor PRs:
- Unit tests for changed logic in `tests/unit/`
- Wrapper contract tests for CLI parity
- Golden tests for critical bootstrap config sections
- Lint + format checks for modified Python scope

Current key test suites:
- `tests/unit/test_shell_wrapper_contracts.py`
- `tests/unit/test_bootstrap_config_golden.py`
- `tests/unit/test_core_decorators.py`

## Validation Checklist (Pre-Merge)
1. `bash -n scripts/*.sh scripts/lib/*.sh`
2. `python3 -m py_compile` for modified Python files
3. `ruff check scripts tests`
4. `black --check scripts tests`
5. `python3 -m unittest discover -s tests/unit -p 'test_*.py'`
6. Live bootstrap smoke in cluster:
   - `bash scripts/bootstrap-all.sh`
   - confirm final phase summary is all `ok`

## Operational Safety Rules
- Prefer additive/idempotent changes.
- Never use destructive `kubectl` or `git` actions unless explicitly requested.
- If live bootstrap fails, capture and document:
  - failing phase
  - failing command
  - relevant pod/job logs
  - exact code remediation applied

## Refactor Sequencing (Ongoing)
High-value next slices:
1. Continue reducing `scripts/bootstrap-apps.py` by extracting remaining cohesive domains.
2. Keep moving subprocess/network/file IO behind `scripts/core/` adapters.
3. Expand contract tests for additional shell wrappers and job-manifest parity.
4. Promote typed config models incrementally for bootstrap JSON sections.
