"""Ops-domain GET routes (ADR-0007 Phase 2 wave 4).

Three routes migrated off the ``handlers_get.handle()`` elif chain:

* ``GET /api/orchestrator/promises/state`` — read-only snapshot of
  the orchestrator's most recent promise-evaluation tick. ADR-0004's
  ``FreshInstallVerifier`` reads this instead of running a parallel
  probe loop, so the verifier's "did the fresh install actually
  work?" answer matches the live auto-heal cycle.
* ``GET /api/runs`` — per-job-run history with optional query
  filters. ``@get("/api/runs")`` covers both the bare path and the
  ``/api/runs?...`` query variants because the dispatch layer
  hands us the path WITHOUT the query string (see
  ``server.py``'s ``urlparse(self.path).path`` split). Query
  parsing happens inside the handler against ``handler.path``,
  which retains the original query string. Drives the Jobs page's
  run-history table.
* ``GET /api/telemetry`` — anonymised cluster metrics. Two modes
  selected by query string: ``?push`` triggers a remote push;
  bare path returns the collected metrics body.

Migration scope vs. brief — pre-flight ``grep`` showed:

* ``/api/stats`` — already in ``routes/stack_update.py`` (wave 3).
* ``/api/versions`` — already in ``routes/stack_update.py``
  (wave 3).
* ``/api/schedules`` — already in ``routes/misc_legacy.py``
  (wave 4 sibling). Per the brief's "SKIP already-registered"
  rule, leave it there.
* ``/api/ops/health`` — already in ``routes/health.py`` and the
  brief explicitly says don't include it.

OpenAPI parity: ``/api/runs`` and
``/api/orchestrator/promises/state`` were not in
``contracts/api/openapi.yaml`` before this wave; this commit adds
both spec entries (Jobs + Operations tags respectively) so the
Router's startup spec-drift check passes. ``/api/telemetry`` was
already declared.

OO discipline (ADR-0007 + project-wide rule):

* ``OpsGetRoutes`` is a ``RouteModule`` subclass with instance
  methods only — no ``@staticmethod``, no loose top-level handler
  functions.
* Dependencies are constructor-injected with module-default fall-
  backs that preserve auto-discovery (the Router calls the class
  with no args). Tests pass stubs to swap behaviour without
  monkey-patching.
* Three named patterns extracted, each isolating a concern that
  was an inline blob in ``handlers_get`` before:

  * ``RunHistoryRepository`` — adapter onto the JSONL run-history
    buffer. Owns the query-string parsing + the parent-name
    resolution that the legacy chain inlined into the route. Pure
    in-memory transform; constructor-injected ``run_history``
    module shim.
  * ``OrchestratorStateAdapter`` — adapter onto
    ``orchestrator_state.read_state``. The legacy chain returned
    the ``(status_code, body)`` tuple straight to the handler;
    wrapping it gives tests a single seam to stub when they don't
    want to touch the real on-disk state file.
  * ``TelemetrySource`` — Strategy that picks between the
    ``collect_metrics`` and ``push_telemetry`` calls based on the
    request's query string. Same inline split lived in the legacy
    chain; named here so tests assert "push? yes/no" without
    re-implementing query-parsing.

* ``except Exception`` is narrow per the project rule — only the
  telemetry push branch logs a swallowed exception via
  ``log_swallowed`` (the legacy version did the same).
